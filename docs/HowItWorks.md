## NOTES

Monopropellant tanks may be added to transfer fuel to Dragon V2 tanks to top them off after safely launching to orbit.

Dragon Solar Panels are no longer needed with the new Dragon V2 trunk and its built-in solar array, but are needed with the Dragon Habitat module and are thus included in both the SpaceX Explorer Expansion kit and SpaceX Exploration Expansion pack.
